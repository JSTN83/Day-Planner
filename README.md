I was still having trouble with dynamic functionality in JS so I left my JS file as is and hard coded
the HTML file. I added time blocks, text area and save buttons with icons. I also added a little color 
to the text area. I was not able to bring the time blocks and save button closer to the text area. 
As I previously mentioned when we had our talk, I'm taking the necessary measures to help me 
better understand JS and Jquery before I start falling way behind.
